# Snake-Game-with-c-

Repository Description:

Welcome to the Snake Game in C++ repository! This project contains a simple and interactive implementation of the classic Snake game using C++. The game is developed to run in a console window and showcases fundamental programming concepts such as arrays, loops, enums, and game logic.

Features:

Dynamic Game Board: The game board updates in real-time, displaying the snake, fruits, and score.
Responsive Controls: Control the snake using the W, A, S, and D keys to move up, left, down, and right respectively.
Random Fruit Generation: Fruits appear at random positions on the board, providing an ever-changing challenge.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, increasing with each fruit eaten.
Game Over Detection: The game detects collisions with walls and the snake's own body to determine game over conditions.
